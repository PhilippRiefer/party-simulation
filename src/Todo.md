# To Do List

## Problems

- The Personal Avatars don't have a way of finding out if their move was legal or not. How do we give them the array of what is around them? What do we do if they get stuck for several turns?

## Environment

- Add objects

## Environment / Simulation Control

- Implement a way to figure out if an Avatar got stuck, and if it did, what to do next

## Personal Avatars

- Implement error handling: If your Avatar has not changed position in some time, maybe it should move somewhere else.
