# To Do List

## Environment

- Add objects
- Rectify the room size

## Environment / Simulation Control

- Implement a way to figure out if an Avatar got stuck, and if it did, what to do next

## Personal Avatars

- Implement error handling: If your Avatar has not changed position in some time, maybe it should move somewhere else.
