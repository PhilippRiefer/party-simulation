# To-Do List for SimulationControl Package Development

## General Tasks
- **Documentation**
  - Ensure comprehensive JavaDoc documentation for each class and method to explain their functionality clearly.
  - Update documentation whenever code changes are made to keep it consistent and helpful.

- **Testing**
  - Develop unit tests for `SimulationControl` methods, particularly focusing on avatar creation, movement, and interaction logic.
  - Implement integration tests that simulate the entire workflow to ensure that all components work together as expected.

- **Error Handling**
  - Implement robust error handling throughout the simulation control processes, especially in methods that interact with external libraries or handle user input.

## Main.java
- **Enhance Input Handling**
  - Implement checks to ensure that the user input for perception range is valid (e.g., positive numbers).
  - Consider adding a loop or retry mechanism for invalid inputs rather than closing the scanner immediately after one input.

- **Refactor Scanner Usage**
  - Ensure the scanner is closed appropriately without causing issues if the program needs to read more input later.

## SimulationControl.java
- **Optimize Reflections Usage**
  - Optimize the use of the Reflections library to minimize startup delay and resource usage. Consider caching results if the class structure does not change frequently.

- **Improve Error Management**
  - Improve error handling around reflection and instantiation to ensure that errors are logged and handled gracefully without stopping the simulation unexpectedly.

- **Enhance Avatar Management**
  - Implement functionality to remove or deactivate avatars dynamically during the simulation if required.
  - Add methods to update avatars' properties or states based on simulation events or conditions.

- **Implement Performance Monitoring**
  - Introduce performance monitoring for critical sections, especially those involving loops and reflection, to identify potential bottlenecks.

## Additional Suggestions
- **User Interface Integration**
  - If applicable, integrate a user interface to control the simulation start, stop, and parameters adjustment dynamically.

- **Dynamic Configuration Loading**
  - Implement functionality to load and apply simulation configurations dynamically from an external source (e.g., configuration file, database).

- **Logging System**
  - Implement a logging system to record significant events, errors, and system states to facilitate debugging and system monitoring.

- **Scalability Considerations**
  - Review the scalability of the `SimulationControl` system. Ensure it can handle a large number of avatars and complex simulations without significant performance degradation.

- **Modularization**
  - Consider modularizing the simulation control to separate concerns further and enhance maintainability. For example, separate the avatar management, environment control, and simulation logic into different modules or classes.

## Example of Improved Error Handling in SimulationControl
```java
public void loopThroughAvatars() {
    for (SuperAvatar avatar : avatars) {
        try {
            ArrayList<SpaceInfo> si = environment.getAdjacentToAvatar(avatar.getAvatarID(), avatar.getPerceptionRange());
            Direction dir = avatar.yourTurn(si);
            boolean hasMoved = environment.moveAvatar(avatar.getAvatarID(), dir);
            avatar.setHasMoved(hasMoved);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error processing avatar " + avatar.getAvatarID() + ": " + e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
