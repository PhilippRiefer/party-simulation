# To-Do List for AvatarInterface Package Development

## General Tasks
- **Documentation**
  - Ensure that all classes and methods are fully documented with JavaDoc comments to explain functionalities and parameters clearly.
  - Update any existing comments to ensure clarity and completeness.

- **Testing**
  - Develop and run unit tests for all methods in `SuperAvatar` and `TemplateAvatar` classes.
  - Include tests for edge cases, such as boundary movements and interactions with different `SpaceType` configurations.

- **Performance Evaluation**
  - Assess the performance of the method implementations, especially those that might be called frequently or in computationally intensive contexts.

## AvatarInterface.java
- **Review and Refine**
  - Ensure that the interface adequately defines all necessary methods that any avatar should implement.
  - Check if additional methods are required for enhanced control or information retrieval about the avatar state.

## SuperAvatar.java
- **Method Implementation**
  - Ensure all abstract methods from `AvatarInterface` are properly implemented.
  - Review the logic in methods to handle special cases or potential errors (e.g., invalid perception range).

- **Enhance Functionality**
  - Consider adding methods to handle more complex avatar states or behaviors, such as energy levels, interactions with other avatars, or environmental changes.

## TemplateAvatar.java
- **Implement Advanced Strategies**
  - Replace the placeholder random movement strategy in `yourTurn` with a more sophisticated algorithm that uses `spacesInRange` to make decisions.
  - Consider implementing strategies based on the type of space (e.g., avoiding obstacles, moving towards a goal).

- **Improve Random Movement Method**
  - Ensure that the `randomDirection` method is robust and truly random. Consider using a better randomization technique if necessary.

- **Optimization**
  - Optimize any methods that are used frequently to ensure they run efficiently.

- **Integration Testing**
  - Test the `TemplateAvatar` in the simulation environment to ensure it interacts correctly with the system, especially with the room setup and other avatars.

## Additional Suggestions
- **Enhance Avatar Customization**
  - Allow for more customizable avatar properties such as speed, behavior patterns, or response to environmental factors.
  
- **Dynamic Interaction**
  - Implement methods to dynamically adjust avatar properties in response to simulation changes (e.g., modify perception range based on environmental factors).

- **Error Handling**
  - Add comprehensive error handling and logging for all critical operations, especially those involving avatar movement and interaction with the environment.
